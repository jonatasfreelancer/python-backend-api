## üöÄ Key Features & Solutions Implemented

This API template is engineered to meet common client requirements for a reliable backend system:

* **RESTful Routing:** Clear, predictable routes (`/`) for easy integration with any frontend application (e.g., React, Vue, Mobile Apps).
* **Minimalist & Scalable Architecture:** Built on Flask, ensuring a small footprint, fast execution, and a simple path to scaling with tools like Gunicorn or serverless functions.
* **Production-Ready Dependencies:** Uses `requirements.txt` for fast, reproducible environment setup, eliminating dependency conflicts.
* **Demonstrated Expertise:** The code includes practical logic and error handling, showcasing the ability to deliver clean, functional code under a client's specific requirements.
